# FS2020 Tour de France Flight Plans and Maps

These routes I have mapped are designed to closely follow the 2020 Tour de France, which runs from Saturday Aug 29th and ends Sunday Sept 20th if all goes according to scheldule. There may be some slight inaccuracies in terms of exactly which road the route follows, and how closely the map renders these selections into the MS2020 Bing Maps system. But you should be able to follow the combination of roads and waypoints farily easily. I have meticulously chosen waypoints off of satelite maps, and imported them into each route flight plan. The waypoints are numbered in sequence (WP5, WP6, WP7, etc), and I have inserted the names of most of the major climbs (Cat 2, 1, and HC). Most waypoints average 2-5 miles, depending on the route plan. But there are a few that have .5 mile spacing due to some tight turns. 

Feel free to choose whichever aircraft you like for these routes. However, to get the chance to really see the beauty of the French countryside, mountains, valleys, and coastlines, it is recommended to use a single prop plane such as the Cub or Cessna. Try to touch each waypoint on the route! If you miss one, go back and try again, so that all subsequent waypoints will show up in sequence as you progress to the end of each stage. I have found that as long as you get to within .2 miles of each WP, the next WP in the sequence will show up when you pass the previous WP by .2 miles. If you miss it, simply circle back and try again. 

Each route starts and ends at an airport closest to the start and end of each stage. This is the only way I can generate each end-to-end flight plan. Based on average airspeeds of 70 to 90 knots, most routes can be done within an hour. Maybe a bit more or less depending on how far away an airport is from the start or end of each stage, or if you take extended pauses to drone around the countryside. If you fly the Cub bush plane, then you might be able to just land anywhere you want after reaching the end of the stage (like a flat riverbank or field), but I have not tried this myself.  

For visual reference, there are picture files for each stage map, as well as profiles showing elevation changes. But you will also find the route appears in the Visual Map display in FS2020. I will also work on providing hyperlinks to more detailed route information, all of which is freely available online. 

Comment back if any questions! 

Thank you,
