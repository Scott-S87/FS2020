# FS2020 Tour de France Flight Plans and Maps

These routes I have mapped are designed to closely follow the 2020 Tour de France, which runs from Saturday Aug 29th and ends Sunday Sept 20th. There may be some slight inaccuracies in terms of exactly which road the route follows, and how closely the map renders these selections into the MS2020 Bing Maps system. But you should be able to follow the combination of roads and waypoints farily easily. I have meticulously chosen waypoints off of satelite maps, and imported them into each route flight plan. The waypoints are numbered in sequence (WP5, WP6, WP7, etc), and I have inserted the names of most of the major climbs (Cat 2, 1, and HC). Most waypoints average 2-5 miles, depending on the route plan. But there are a few that have .5 mile spacing due to some tight turns. 

It is recommended to use a single prop plane such as the Cub or Cessna, as some routes have lots of twists and turns. Try to touch each waypoint. If you miss one, go back and try again, so all subsequent waypoints show up in sequence as the flight plan progresses. Generally, as long as you get to within .2 miles of each WP, the next WP in the sequence will appear after passing the previous WP by about .2 miles. 

Right-click to download any stage .pln file (or the ZIP file containing all) to your PC, then load into the FS2020 flight plan. Each route starts and ends at an airport closest to the start and end of each stage. Based on average airspeeds of 70 to 90 knots, most routes can be done within an hour. Maybe a bit more or less depending on how far away an airport is from the start or end of each stage, or if you take extended pauses to drone around the countryside. If you fly the Cub, then you might be able to just land anywhere you want after reaching the end of the stage (like a flat riverbank or field).  

I have also created a monster 1675 nm flight plan, that starts in Nice, and ends in Paris on the Champs-Elysees. It does not follow the route of each stage, but rather hits the start and end points of each stage. I think FS2020 allows you to save flights in progress as a .flt file. So completing the full route can probably be done over the course of several sessions.  

There are maps of each stage, as well as profiles showing elevation changes. All waypoints should appear on the Visual Map display in FS2020. 

Comment back if any questions!
