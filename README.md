# FS2020 Flight Plans and Maps

My place to post FS2020 routes. When possible I will provide maps for addiitonal guidance, but in most cases the VFR map view in FS2020 will be good enough. 

Try to hit each waypoint on the route. If you miss one, go back and try again, so that all subsequent waypoints will show up as planned. 

Comment back if any questions! 

Thanks,
Scott
