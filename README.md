# FS2020 Flight Plans and Maps

These routes I have mapped are designed to closely follow the 2020 Tour de France. There may be some slight inaccuracies in terms of exactly which road the route follows, and how closely the map renders these selections into the MS2020 Bing Maps system. I have meticulously chosen waypoints (WP) off of satelite maps, and imported them into the route flight plan. The waypoints are numbered in sequence, and I have inserted the names of most of the major climbs (Cat 2, 1, and HC), but I cannot promise all will be there. Each route starts and ends at an airport closest to the start and end of each stage. 

You are free to choose whichever aircraft you like. However, due to some of the tight undulations of some routes, it is recommended to use single prop planes such as the Cub or Cesna so you can be nimble enough to navigate some of the tight turns Based on flight speed between 90 and 70 knots, most routes can be done within an hour. Maybe a bit more depending on how far away an airport is from the start or end of each stage. 

Try to hit each waypoint on the route! If you miss one, go back and try again, so that all subsequent waypoints will show up in sequence as you progress to the end of each stage. I have found that as long as you get to within .2 miles of each WP, the next will show up in sequence. If not, circle back and try again. Most waypoints average 2-4 miles in between, depending on the route plan. But there are a few that have .5 mile spacing due to tight turns. 

For your convenience I have also attempted to provide picture files for each stage overhead map, as well as profile showing elevation changes. I will also work on providing links to more detailed route information, all of which is freely available online. 

Comment back if any questions! 

Thanks,
Scott
