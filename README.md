# FS2020 Flight Plans and Maps

These routes I have mapped are designed to closely follow the 2020 Tour de France, which runs from Friday Aug 29th and ends Sunday Sept 20 if all goes according to scheldule. There may be some slight inaccuracies in terms of exactly which road the route follows, and how closely the map renders these selections into the MS2020 Bing Maps system. But you shoule be able to follow the combination of roads and waypoints. I have meticulously chosen waypoints off of satelite maps, and imported them into the route flight plan. The waypoints are numbered in sequence (WP5, WP6, WP7, etc), and I have inserted the names of most of the major climbs (Cat 2, 1, and HC) as their own waypoints. Most waypoints average 2-4 miles in between, depending on the route plan. But there are a few that have .5 mile spacing due to tight turns. 

You are free to choose whichever aircraft you like. However, due to some of the tight undulations of some routes, it is recommended to use single prop planes such as the Cub or Cesna so you can be nimble enough to navigate some of the tight turns. Try to hit each waypoint on the route! If you miss one, go back and try again, so that all subsequent waypoints will show up in sequence as you progress to the end of each stage. I have found that as long as you get to within .2 miles of each WP, the next will show up in sequence. If not, circle back and try again. 

Based on flight velocity between 90 and 70 knots, most routes can be done within an hour. Maybe a bit more depending on how far away an airport is from the start or end of each stage. Each route starts and ends at an airport closest to the start and end of each stage. This is the only way I can generate each end-to-end flight plan. If you fly the Cub, then you might be able to just land anywhere you want to end the stage, but I have not tried this myself.  

For your convenience I have also attempted to provide JPGs for each stage map, as well as profiles showing elevation changes. I will also work on providing links to more detailed route information, all of which is freely available online. 

Comment back if any questions! 

Thank you,
